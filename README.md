Enables easy music management

TODO
=========

- Adding tags, grading, and so massively,
- Easier tagging and grading by invoking "find" by default. (ms tag jackson MJ - tag any songs with jackson as MJ)
- possibility to remove/ add new songs, without destroying whole library(tags, scores and so)
- maybe creating appropriate folders, but that could be dangerous
- mv in repair fails in the case tags contain special chars like '/', '\'', '`'
- prevent from changing names/tags
- add possibility to leave numbers corresponding to the index in folder.
- clean functions to color text. Its wayy too ugly now.
