musicsweeper
============

Enables easy music management

TODO
=========

- Adding tags, grading, and so massively,
- Easier tagging and grading by invoking "find" by default
- possibility to remove/ add new songs, without destroying whole library(tags, scores and so)
- maybe creating appropriate folders, but that could be dangerous
